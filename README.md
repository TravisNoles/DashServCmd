# DashServCmd v0.1.0

DashServCmd is an open source application that assists with both the development,
deployment and allows for cross-platform use of your application no matter which
environment the end-user will use. DashServCmd is a flexible application that can
not only be used by developers, but can also be used by end-users as well.

DashServCmd strives to be an all-in-one user friendly platform for all applications.
Making the use of Vagrant, Docker and other virtual environments it won't matter
which configuration, operating system you or the end-user is using. It keeps
the end-user's system clean of temporary files, and makes it easy to manage,
configure and run.

Note: Unstable development in-process. This app hasn't been tested or verified
to run yet. Working on a working version of v0.1.0.
