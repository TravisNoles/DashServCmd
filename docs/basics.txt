DashServCMD Basics
v0.1.0

Overview

  1) Launch application via dashserv.
  2) DSC launches application via docker-py.
  3) Docker runs .sh (app run file) to start app.
  

Application Creation

  Applications in dashservcmd have a very basic "init system," the file
  is called, "applications.py" This python file manages, starts, stops
  and launches applications for dashservcmd.

  Applications are containerized with docker. This allows much flexibility,
  allowing the apps to even run outside dashservcmd. Dashservcmd is just
  a wrapper that allows for running your apps easier.
